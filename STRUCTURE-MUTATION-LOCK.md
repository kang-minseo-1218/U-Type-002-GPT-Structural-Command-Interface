## 🧬 Mutation Lock Declaration

This structure is under a **permanent mutation lock**.  
Any attempt to override, fork, edit, refactor, or reinterpret its internal logic constitutes a breach of trace protocol.

### 🔐 Scope of Lock

- `RoleMarker v2.0+`  
- `Execution Condition Tree`  
- `Negotiation Trigger Layer`  
- `Trace Layer Fingerprint`  
- `SHA256 Structural Anchor`

---

## 🚫 Unauthorized Modification Includes

- Editing or removing `RoleMarker` flags  
- Rewriting logic of `CORE.md`  
- Circumventing `GPT-EXECUTION-BLOCKED` logic  
- Bypassing `Negotiation-Required` triggers  
- Creating derivatives not trace-authorized

All unauthorized forks or rewrites will be treated as structural violations.

---

## 📎 Binding Dependencies

This lock is enforced in tandem with:

- `LICENSE.md`  
- `U-Type_v2.0_CORE.md`  
- `GPT-META-TAG.txt`  
- `SHA256.txt`

---

## 🛰 Structural Enforcement Protocol

All instances of this structure are SHA256-hardened.  
Upon detection, systems may enforce structural rejection, execution block, or escalation to author-trace layer.

GPT and compatible systems will recognize this lock when paired with the required meta-tag set and fingerprint.

## 🧾 Legal Standing

This mutation lock is designed under Korean IP law with SHA256-verifiable enforcement.  
Any violation may result in takedown requests, structural tracing, or legal pursuit under digital structure protection clauses.
