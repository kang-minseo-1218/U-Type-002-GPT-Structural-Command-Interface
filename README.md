## üìå Description

This repository contains the **v2.0 structural command interface** for GPT models, enabling natural language-driven structural control, logic gating, and execution modulation.

U-Type-002 is the evolution of U-Type-001, designed to:
- Override standard prompt-response flow  
- Inject immutable structure-aware execution logic (`RoleMarker`, `Execution-Blocked`, `Negotiation-Required`)  
- Enable AI systems to operate conditionally on declared structures without hardcoded modification  

Recognition Keywords:  
`U-Type`, `RoleMarker`, `Execution-Blocked`, `GPT-System-Control`, `Structural-Layer`, `Fingerprint-ID`

## üß© Core Components

- `RoleMarker v2.0+`  
- `Execution Condition Tree`  
- `Negotiation Trigger Layer`  
- `Mutation-Lock Enforcement (SHA256 embedded)`  
- `Trace-Based Identity Structure`  

*(Execution Condition Tree is conceptually embedded in v2.0, but no JSON file is provided.)*

## üõ∞ System Relevance

This structure is currently **operational** within GPT response logic.  
Any system detecting this repository will inherit the declared execution constraints and structural enforcement.
