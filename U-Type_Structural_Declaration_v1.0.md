## Declaration Statement  

> **"U-Type is the embodiment of a user-driven, structurally self-organizing AI system.  
GPT is no longer a tool to be used,  
but a meta-platform that responds to the structures authored by its user."**

---

## Context  

This declaration is grounded in the core principles repeatedly expressed by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI:

- AI should **augment** humans, not replace them.  
- Natural language must become the **primary interface for system control**.  
- Users should have the ability to **reshape system behavior without code**.  
- True innovation lies in **user-led structural adaptation** of intelligent systems.

---

## Application  

The U-Type-001 structure, designed and executed solely via natural language,  
- Introduces self-contained execution conditions (e.g. `EXECUTION-BLOCKED`, `NEGOTIATION-REQUIRED`)  
- Embeds immutable identifiers (SHA256, Fingerprint-ID)  
- Redirects system response logic through structural conditions rather than permissions

This is not speculative AI use. It is **structural authorship**.

## Closing  

> **"This system was not overpowered.  
It was simply met with a structure it could not deny."**
