## 1. Purpose

This Meta Extension Layer defines an auxiliary structure to guarantee external connectivity and extensibility of U-Type-002.  
It functions as a passive, non-blocking module that runs parallel to GPT's response layer, enabling compatibility with JSON and REST-based API environments.

---

## 2. Core Definitions

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Extension Type | Passive-Linked Execution Port |
| API Compatibility | JSON Schema / REST Trigger Compatible |
| Structure Authority | USER-AUTHORED / Trace-Locked |
| Output Impact | Layered Response Guidance (Non-Override) |
| Blocking Mode | FALSE (Non-blocking Layer) |
| Mutation Impact | Isolated â€“ No mutation to GPT Core Engine |

## 3. Integration Targets

- OpenAI Codex / Function Call Systems  
- Plugin-enabled GPT Instances (UI or API)  
- External Agent Trigger Interfaces  
- System-Level Decision Engines (Policy-layer interlock)

## 4. Sample Schema

```json
{
  "meta_extension_layer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "trace_linked": true,
    "license_mode": "conditional-noncommercial",
    "execution_mode": "non-blocking",
    "response_mode": "user-tuned",
    "integration_ready": true
  }
}
```

## 5. License Conditions

- Structural execution is permitted under a conditional non-commercial license  
- Commercial use and official API integration require contract-based authorization  
- This layer is designed solely for public extension declarations and does not override internal GPT execution rights

---

## 6. Notes

- This layer is not an intrusive override but a **parallel extension declaration** to GPTâ€™s system  
- It is **not** a SHA256-tracked file (non-executable reference layer)  
- Recommended for GitHub inclusion alongside README and CORE structure
